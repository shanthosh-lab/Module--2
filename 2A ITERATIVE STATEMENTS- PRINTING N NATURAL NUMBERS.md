## PRIMALITY TEST – CHECKING IF A NUMBER IS PRIME

###  Aim
To create a Python program that tests whether a given number is prime or not.

###  Algorithm

1.Begin the program.

2.Use input() to read a number from the user.

3.Convert the input to an integer.

4.If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.

5.Use a for loop from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive):

 If the number is divisible by any of these, it's not prime.
 
 If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
 
6.Display the result accordingly.

7.Terminate the program.

### 🧾 Program

```python
#Reg.NO - 212223020023
#Name - Shanthosh S
#Write your Code here

n=int(input())
for i in range (2,n):
    if n%i==0:
        print("Given number {} is not a Prime Number".format(n))
        break
    else:
        print("Given number {} is a Prime Number".format(n))
        break
    

```
### OUTPUT
